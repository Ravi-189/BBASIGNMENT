                Lau founded OnePlus with the intent to design a smartphone that would balance high-end quality with a lower price than other phones in its class, believing that users would "never settle" (a slogan that would come to be used by OnePlus in its marketing material) for the lower-quality devices produced by other companies. Lau also showed aspirations of being the "Muji of the tech industry", emphasizing its focus on high-quality products with simplistic, user-friendly designs.[10] Continuing Lau's association with the platform from the Oppo N1,[11] OnePlus entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Cyanogen Inc. to base its products' Android distribution upon a variant of the popular custom ROM CyanogenMod and use its trademarks outside of China.[12][13] OnePlus would later develop a version of CyanogenMod, known as Cyanogen OS, for use in its phones

                Random-access memory, or RAM, is a form of phone data storage that stores data and apps currently being used. RAM can be read and written randomly at any time, in any order and from any physical location, and will release the data put on it when the phone is turned off. When you run apps, all the live running processes run on RAM. If you run multiple apps at the same time, you might face the insufficient RAM issue. Therefore, clear your RAM often is recommended to get a smoother experience
